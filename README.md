# Billify
Billify was my first big project that taught me how to use Java Maven, and expand on my existing knowledge of JavaFX. Billify includes expense tracking, allowing users to input and categorize their expenses, which includes their bills, groceries, insurances, entertainment, and savings, etc. Income management will also be included in Billify via the ability to add paychecks, freelancing deposits for things such as Doordash or Instacart, and other forms of income. Another function would be calculating how much money is left after a selectable timeframe, as low as a day, and as large as a year, allowing the user to get a wide range of information on how much money is left over or missing after expenses. In addition to net balance calculation, the end-user can view summaries, charts, and trends all related to their financial activities, giving the user total control over how they can view their expenses and income.
